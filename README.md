my learning curve

Hello!
I am Kalvin.
My story: straight out of college I started working in a graphic design studio where it was my duty to work with customers in designing flyers, menus, banners, posters, shop signs and more. I worked with fabrics, vynil and other mediums and every day I would learn something new. This was something I truly enjoyed so much and my goal was to expand my skills and become a full-stack graphic designer however life became hectic and a there were too many obstacles in my path so I unfortunately had to leave my passion behind and find fulltime work in another field. It was always something I hoped I could one day pick back up, and now at the age of 29 I am back with more passiona and ambition. I am going to become a full-stack graphic designer, coding and making websites & apps alongside creating beautiful user interfaces. I will brush up on all my old knowledge and skills alongside my new found interest and love for coding to create an amazing portfolio.
